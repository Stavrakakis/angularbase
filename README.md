angularbase
===========

```
npm install
```

This should install all dependencies.

You may need to install grunt

```
npm install -g grunt
```

Restart your shell session to refresh the path and then:

```
grunt
```

This will *compile* the source, check for linting and test failures, then run a development server (and test runner server).
